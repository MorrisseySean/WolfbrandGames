		<h3>06/02/2015 - PIP Connectivity And Playtesting</h3>
		<p>Game testing today and another chance to gain more marks. Overall I think it went well, a lot of people who played it were left saying it was pretty fun with others asking to play a few times. Unfortunately the person marking didn't seem too impressed but you win some you lose some.<br>
		Alot of time this sprint was taken up with integrating <a href = "https://thepip.com/">PIP</a>, a stress sensor which uses electrical charges on the surface of the skin to test for stress responses. As you can see from their site, the initial product's goal is to provide a way to manage and relieve stress, 
		I decided to do the opposite and use it as a way to add another layer of stress to an already tense game. The PIP works on receiving stressing and relaxing "events", when my game receives a stressing event, I dim the flashlight by a factor of 5%, over the course of the game players will have to manage their 
		stress levels while dealing with everything the game throws at them. Of course, upon receiving a relaxing event, I give back 5%. It all adds to the atmosphere of the game although it gives an advantage to those who are stress free.<br>
		It was an interesting idea and I was surprised how well it worked. Although it was both not the intended use of the device and something I doubt very many people will be able to experience, it was fun seeing how it works and integrates with a game such as mine. Next on the list: Multiplayer</p>

		<h3>26/01/2015 - Directional Changes for Slither</h3>
		<p>Welcome to my blog, where I'll be talking about the development of my games and all that may entail. Being in my final year of college I've undertaken Slither as my year long project. Initially the games concept was quite simple and followed the lines of games
		like Slender and Amnesia. You were to venture forth from the starting area and find the supplies while keeping well away from the invincible bad guy. All in 2 Dimensions. From the get go I had plans to implement the PIP stress device to track your stress and lower or raise the strength of
		your flashlight based on how stressed you were getting.<br>
		However, recent talks with my mentor on how to keep the game moving forward recently changed the games direction. We felt that the games premise was too boring and needed some fleshing out and I came up with the idea of making the game a survival game. No longer is it a mad dash to the finish, 
		but hunger and thirst bars, aswell as sanity keep you exploring and searching for food and water, anything else you can find is a bonus that may help, or hinder progress. It's a huge game change but has definitely added to the pace of the game and while it's not as scary as it was before 
		it's a much more fun. I'm working on getting PIP to work as well as fleshing out the new game mechanics so it'll be a busy two weeks leading up to the end of sprint 3 but I'm sure happier with the results.</p>
